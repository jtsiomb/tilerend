========

About
-----
Tilerend is a special-purpose raytracer, for rendering tiles or sprites into
tilesheets/spritesheets, for use by retro games.

Many kinds of games running on old computers and consoles, place pre-rendered
tiles onto the screen, to draw the game world, and sprites to represent
characters or other movable objects. Tilerend can read a file with any number of
3D models, exported by a modelling program such as blender or maya, and follow a
"render script" to render multiple arbitrary groupings of 3D objects from that
file, as separate tiles/sprites in a bigger tilesheet/spritesheet.

See under `examples` for example 3D files and render-scripts you can execute,
and see the output generated by tilerend (TODO).
